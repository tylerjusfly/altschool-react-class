Virtual Dom =>
    a virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object.
    a virtual DOM has the same attributes as the DOM, but it lacks the ability to change what's on the screen.
    Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster, because nothing gets drawn onscreen. 
    Ex - Think of Manipulating the virtual Dom as editing a blueprint of a building instead of moving rooms in an actual buliding.

    In summary, hereâ€™s what happens when you try to update the DOM in React:

    The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
    The virtual DOM gets compared to what it looked like before you updated it. React figures out which objects have changed.
    The changed objects, and the changed objects only, get updated on the real DOM.
    Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change.
